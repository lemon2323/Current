    <h1> Tired of losing in Overwatch? I have your solution</h1>
    
    <p> With 22 characters to choose from and six members on a team, sometimes it can be difficult to compose a winning team in <a href="http://overwatch.wikia.com/wiki/Overwatch_Wiki">Overwatch.</a> . Luckily for you, I have a basic guide that will guide your team to victory. Take this guide with a grain of salt though, Overwatch has a constantly changing meta-game that switches up the strategies. My guide is focused on the current season, Season 2. The guys over at Overbuff.com compiled <a href="https://www.overbuff.com/blog/2016-09-06-overwatch-hero-tier-list-and-meta-report-season-2-meta-boogaloo">analytics of what the pros use in Season 2</a>. While my guide is a good baseline, there will be other team compositions out there that can perform well in certain situations.</p>
    
    <h2> The Healers </h2>

    <p>The most essential part of an Overwatch team is the healer. There is still one must pick healer, Lucio. Every team should have a Lucio because he is the only healer that can heal every member of the team at all times. Lucio also has a speed up ability which is essential to a teamâ€™s movement to get to the objective unharmed. In Season 2, a team should be comprised of two healers. The second healer can be either Zenyatta, Mercy, or Ana. Zenyatta and Ana should be picked if the team needs more damaged while Mercy should be picked if the team would like more healing. Having two healers will help insure that your team stays alive longer than the others.</p>
    
      <h2> The Tanks </h2>

    <p>Along with two healers, a team should be comprised of two tanks. One of the two tanks should have a protective shield that can absorb damage over a longer period of time. The two tanks with such capabilities are Reinhart and D.Va. The 2nd tank has a little more breathing room. I personally like Zarya as the 2nd tank but if the map is a control map the team should have a Winston. Roadhog is in a delicate situation because even though he has the most health in the game, he still plays like a damage per second character. However you compose your team, make sure you pick tanks that will be able to stay alive while protecting your team.</p>
    
     <h2> The Damage per Second Characters </h2>
    
    <img src="dps.jpg">

    <p>Unfortunately, the damage per second (DPS) characters are the most sought after characters in the game. Even though they are the most offensive characters in the game, there should still only be two. Having more than two DPS characters often leaves the team too squishy, which allows for the other team to deal out a massive amount of eliminations. There is a lot of leeway if picking a DPS character. I would suggest always having a Pharah counter as a DPS pick, which includes McCree and Solider 76. These two characters can put out DPS over a long range which makes them a viable pick. The second DPS character on your team can be any of the other DPS characters, as long as they produce. Limiting your teams DPS characters to two will help win games.</p>
    
 <p>While this is a basic guide, there will be other compositions out there that will work. Since Overwatch is consistently changing, it is important to stay on top of the meta-game so your team can have the best chance of winning. </p>
